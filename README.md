* System monitoring and information retrieval
* REST API interaction with SeaTunnel services
* Built-in logging and monitoring tools
* Dynamic connection configuration
* Comprehensive job information and statistics

## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd seatunnel-mcp

# Create virtual environment and install
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Environment Variables

```
SEATUNNEL_API_URL=http://localhost:8090  # Default SeaTunnel REST API URL
SEATUNNEL_API_KEY=your_api_key           # Optional: Default SeaTunnel API key
```

### Dynamic Connection Configuration

The server provides tools to view and update connection settings at runtime:

* `get-connection-settings`: View current connection URL and API key status
* `update-connection-settings`: Update URL and/or API key to connect to a different SeaTunnel instance

Example usage through MCP:

```json
// Get current settings
{
  "name": "get-connection-settings"
}

// Update connection settings
{
  "name": "update-connection-settings",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "http://new-host:8090",
    "api_key": "new-api-key"
  }
}
```

### Job Management

The server provides tools to submit and manage SeaTunnel jobs:

* `submit-job`: Submit a new job with job configuration
* `stop-job`: Stop a running job
* `get-job-info`: Get detailed information about a specific job
* `get-running-jobs`: List all currently running jobs
* `get-finished-jobs`: List all finished jobs by state (FINISHED, CANCELED, FAILED, etc.)

### Running the Server

```bash
python -m src.seatunnel_mcp
```
